Etherscan data is wonderful, but pulling data from their API can be tricky sometimes. Even AI has trouble building working scripts (and yet somehow the new narrative is to trust AI to manage your tokens?  HFSP…)

We needed to analyze a user’s comprehensive inflow/outflow of tokens on an L2, so we thought to publish the scripts we use so as to save you time.  Using this repository, you can easily identify a specific user and tokens you are interested in tracking to visualize their entire history.

For instance, you can see token inflows and outflows for a Curve user…

The Jupyter Notebook shows off several visualizations you can run once you’ve scraped the data.  For instance, perhaps you want to view the data chronologically

Or identify major counterparty addresses…

Or summarize inflows versus outflows
